Our technology industry can help us expand the reach of our democracy and the
resourcefulness of our non-profit organizations. With 20 years experience
designing information management systems for local tech firms and non profit
organizations and my background in social media strategy we can use technology
platforms to address social issues like homelessness, public safety voter
engagement. I’m proud to have laid some of this groundwork. Because of my
familiarity with social media strategy, I’ve been able to deliver information
to between one and two million viewers each month.
