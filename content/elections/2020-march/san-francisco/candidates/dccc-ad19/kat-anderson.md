San Francisco is a place of pushing boundaries and opening up new frontiers -
physical and virtual, As such, San Francisco is uniquely situated to not only
embrace the tech industry, but to be the place of its greatest economic driver.
I support ethical innovation of all kinds, including tech, and will always push
San Francisco to embrace innovation and to support the workers that make that
happen, Our city is fortunate to be a magnet for tech, and the talented folks
who are inventors, creators and supporters in and of tech, I would be honored
to have the endorsement, support and votes of Tech Workers.
